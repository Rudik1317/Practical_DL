On the other hand, the scene where the TV goes fuzzy is based in fact. Before Doppler radar and weather radio, we were taught that if you turned your TV to a particular channel ( not on cable ) and tuned the brightness just right, you could tell if there was a tornado coming. The problem was that by then you would be able to hear it. < br / > < br / > Since I know something about midwest tornadoes, it made this movie fun for me. I enjoy it more than Twister. I mean, give me a break - there is no way you could make it through and F5 by chaining yourself to a pipe in a well house. [SEP]\n"

And this is after they take a raft on a camping trip, with no gear, and show up at a campsite that is already assembled and completely stocked with food and clothes and the daughters headphones. Additionally, after their boat goes missing, they panic that they're stuck in the woods, but then the daughters boyfriend just shows up and they apparently never consider that they could just hike out of the woods like he did to get to them.

    "## Main assignment - <u>actually</u> train the model (8 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Your main task for this week is to use the RLHF pipeline to train a model for a reward of your choice. Here's what you can choose from:\n",
    "\n",
    "__A. Toxicity fine-tuning:__ train the model to be less (or more!) toxic. For this task, you may use the data from [jigsaw toxic comments](https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge) and [lmsys/toxic-chat](https://huggingface.co/datasets/lmsys/toxic-chat),  or any other source. Alternatively, you may use toxicity scores from [oasst1](https://huggingface.co/datasets/OpenAssistant/oasst1).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "__B. Actual human feedback:__ use one of the existing datasets with pairwise human feedback to align your langauge model. You may use [anthropic's hh-rlhf](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Anthropic/hh-rlhf), [OpenAssistant dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/OpenAssistant/oasst1) or any other data you see fit. You may also turn the tables and train the model to [minimize](https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ac7/2ad/827/ac72ad82767d4132164a4b6b76196c42.jpg) human preferences, as long as your model does not degrade to gibberish.\n",
    "\n",
    "__C. Controlled generation:__ Instead of training a reward model from human feedback, you may define the reward function as the text length (longer or shorter) or number of times the model uses specific words (e.g. \"sorry\", \"apologize\"). If you choose specific words, make sure the model generates them at least sometimes.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Alternatively,__ you may choose a different task. However, unless your task is very similar to one of the above, there is a chance that it will be **significantly** harder to solve, requiring orders of magnitude more compute and tuning. If you are in doubt, please ask the course staff. If they are AFK (again >.<), please prefer one of the recommended tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### General tips & tricks\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Things to look out for:\n",
    "- during PPO stage, the reward model should be in eval mode (dropout disabled)\n",
    "- make sure max_length and max_new_tokens are enough for your chosen dataset - at least most of the time\n",
    "- when in doubt, view the data manually or inspect how the model performs on a few samples\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We highly recommend that you manually check the performance after each sub-stage:\n",
    "1. when you assembled the pairwise dataset, inspect a couple of from of *your* dataset class and detokenize them. Make sure that you-the-human understand why one sample was accepted and the other - rejected. At least most of the time. This also lets you spot tokenization/truncation errors.\n",
    "2. after you trained a reward model, measure how accurate this model is in isolation. If your reward model is poor, any subsequent RLHF will also fail.\n",
    "3. once you've trained the main model with RL, ask it to generate examples and explore how well it does. If it produces an obviously bad output, check if the reward model assigns high reward to that output. If yes, reward model is the culprit; if no, it's a question of better/longer PPO training.\n",
    "\n",
    "__It is also a good idea to periodically print samples during training.__\n",
    "\n",
    "__When stuck, simplify the problem.__ If you've spent a several hours enchanting the reward model but it still won't budge, try switching to a simple subtask. For instance, if you're training on hh-rlhf, try limiting it the dataset to 10% of the shortest sequences - they are typically easier to learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assignment stages (and grading)\n",
    "\n",
    "Regardless of the specific task you chose, your solution needs to contain several parts that will be graded separately.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Stage 1: reward model (4 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "Construct a dataset for training the reward model on your problem. Then, train a reward model on that dataset and evaluate how well can your model predict preferences on a hold-out (test) subset of your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please make sure that the part of your notebook where you evaluate reward model is clearly visible and reasonably easy to read. And for all that is holy, do not call it IMDB unless it actually **is** data of imdb movie reviews :)\n",
    "\n",
    "__Not all tasks require a reward model for later PPO fine-tuning.__ For instance, there's no reason to train a reward model if your reward equals sentence length. Likewise, toxicity reward can be estimated with a pre-trained toxicity classifier. __If your task does not require training a reward model, please train an unrelated model on [hh-rlhf](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Anthropic/hh-rlhf) as though you were solving assignment version B.__ This is for grading purposes only, you won't use this model for stage 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Stage 2: RL fine-tuning (4 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the reward model is ready - or you can compute rewards without a model - it is time to maximize that reward with PPO. Optionally, you may replace PPO with another RL algorithm (or unlikelihood learning scheme), but only if you're feeling adventurous.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "First, you need to choose a language model to be fine-tuned. You may choose any model, but make sure that your model **can** generate the data in your format. For instance, [Mistral-7B](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1) is a general purpose LM and may (or may not) need prompt engineering to generate chat assistant responses. For that reason, it is best if you **do not use `\"lvwerra/gpt2-imdb\"` unless you're generating only movie reviews**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two \"difficulty modes\" for this task:\n",
    "For the **easy mode**, use [gpt2-large](https://huggingface.co/gpt2-large) or [opt-1.3b](https://huggingface.co/facebook/opt-1.3b) with minimal code changes.\n",
    "If you want the **Hard mode:** use a larger (e.g. 7B) model in combination with `load_in_4bit` and LoRA, the same way we did last week.\n",
    "Some reasonable model choices are [LLaMA-7B](https://huggingface.co/Enoch/llama-7b-hf), [Falcon-7b](https://huggingface.co/tiiuae/falcon-7b), [Mistral-7B](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1) for general-purpose LM or [guanaco-7b](https://huggingface.co/timdettmers/guanaco-7b), [vicuna-7b](https://huggingface.co/lmsys/vicuna-7b-v1.5) for chat-based tasks, though there are many more (see [leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/HuggingFaceH4/open_llm_leaderboard)). In the hard mode, you will need to modify the training arguments to enable 4-bit fine-tuning. Furthermore, your experiments will take somewhat longer to complete. On the plus side, your model will produce significantly better results.\n",
    "\n",
    "__High reward is not enough!__ RL algorithms are famous for [cheating their reward functions](https://openai.com/research/faulty-reward-functions). To ensure that your model is actually doing what you want it to do, you will need some additional evaluation. To get the full grade, provide at least 20 side-by-side examples of your fine-tuned model vs original model predictions and a short summary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, you may provide 5 examples and some extrinsic evaluation metric over many examples. For instance, you may use a different pre-trained toxicity score for option A. When dealing with human preferences, you may choose to [enlist actual humans](https://toloka.ai/) or [ask GPT4/Claude](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.03277.pdf) to compare your model's predictions. For task C, when optimizing for simple rewards like sentence lengths, it is enough to compare histograms of rewards (e.g. average lengths).\n",
